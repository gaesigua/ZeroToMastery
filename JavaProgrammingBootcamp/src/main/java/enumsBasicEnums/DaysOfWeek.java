//1. With Enums, we declare a set of named constants;
//2. This represents a set of values;
//3. An example of enums is a set of days of a week, or a list of things in a dropdown menu of a web element;
//4. Remember, that since adding or removing a value would require the restart of the application that is why enums must be constants
//6. Let's create a basic enum with days of the week as constants
package enumsBasicEnums;
public enum DaysOfWeek {
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY,
    SUNDAY
}
